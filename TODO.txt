# Coding :

- Automatic background substraction (background tab gui button and algo)
	-> deactivate the other backghround stuff automatically ?
- depth panel (between background and diffencing)
	-> Add near and far clipping in background tab (after projection)
	-> test remapping stuff
	-> ground detection
	-> top / bottom / ... projection
- Syphon tab in Communication panel
	-> Syphon client for overlapping and mapping output
	-> slider for crossfading
- Detecting the pool table and the holes ! -> sending them by Osc
- Find a way to switch to live again -> works but really rarely !

# Roadmap :

- Syphon server to make visuals, being able to do custom visual algorithms ?
- Custom algorithms as plugins (depth descriptor for example)
- New datas to send
	-> custom data for algortihms (or way to plug)
