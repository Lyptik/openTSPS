# Coding :

- Automatic background substraction (background tab gui button and algo)
	-> mix with the progressive background stuff
- depth panel
	-> ground detection
	-> top / bottom / ... / free camera projection
    -> Add remapping option (after projection) -> in case of a foreground window
    -> Add depth screen to see the foreground visual
- Pool table and pool holes detection
- Syphon tab in Communication panel
    -> Syphon input for overlap
	-> slider for crossfading
- Communication :
    - output datas -> ID of TSPS
    - output datas -> rectangle and holes
- Integrate OpenNI2 custom driver and integrate oni sequence stuff

# Roadmap :

- Syphon server to make visual to each point of the pipe
- being able to do custom visual algorithms
- being able to send custom datas
- Adding masks features
- Adding warping of the grid
