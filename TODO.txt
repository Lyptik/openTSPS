# Coding :

- Apply depth clipping and cropiing to the "real" depth buffer
- Automatic background substraction -> Better CPU stuff
- depth panel
	-> ground detection
	-> top / bottom / ... / free camera projection -> see camera objects in openframeworks
    -> Add remapping option (after projection) -> in case of a foreground window
    -> Add depth screen to see the foreground visual (and to use them later on when there will be syphon)
- Pool table and pool holes detection
- Syphon tab in Communication panel
    -> Syphon input for overlap
	-> slider for crossfading
    -> Syphon output at each stage
- Communication :
    - output datas -> ID of TSPS
    - output datas -> pool rectangle and holes
- Integrate OpenNI2 and oni sequence stuff correctly into TSPS and GUI (see with Brett)
- Better skewing and masks stuff -> skewing can not be use if you want to remmap stuff
-> Adding an adjustment panel

# Roadmap :

- Custom algo solution
- Syphon server to make visual to each point of the pipe
- Adding warping of the grid

TOFIX :

- quad gui when not warping should be blocked and crop function should be used instead of warping
-
